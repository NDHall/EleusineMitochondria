## _Eleusine_ Mitochondria

Set of scripts used to create mitochondrial genome for _Eleusine indica_(Poaceae) it also includes scripts used to create a series of heatmaps from SRAs downloaded from NCBI, scripts used in exon assembly, alignment and analysis, scripts used for validation which will include those used to get information for connection plot, depth, and vizualize the comparisons of sequenced genome features to putative mitochondrial contigs.  

I have divided srcripts up based on parts of the project they were used for, such as cleaning, heatmap, exon_assembly etc...

A word about errors. Most of these scripts are programed to throw few errors be careful with file format and make sure the results are sane (8 Feb 2017). I will work to update the code to make it more stringent, but I advise caution and looking at the results of each script, as you would with any new or unfamilar code.
